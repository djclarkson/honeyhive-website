              <p>
                We're thrilled to announce a major update to HoneyHive, introducing powerful cybersecurity workflow automation capabilities to help security teams respond faster to threats, streamline incident management, and maintain compliance more efficiently.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Since our launch, we've seen how workflow automation transforms team communication. Now, we're bringing that same power to cybersecurity operations with specialized tools designed for security teams.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Why Cybersecurity Automation?</h2>
              
              <p>
                Security teams face unprecedented challenges: increasing threat volumes, alert fatigue, skill shortages, and complex compliance requirements. HoneyHive's new cybersecurity automation features help address these challenges by:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond (MTTR) to security incidents</li>
                <li>Standardizing response procedures with automated playbooks</li>
                <li>Eliminating manual, repetitive tasks in security workflows</li>
                <li>Streamlining compliance documentation and evidence collection</li>
              </ul>
